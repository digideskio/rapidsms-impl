In python 2.6, the locale module has a hard-coded dictionary
locale.locale_alias that Django uses to check for installed 
languages. Since Tigrinya is not in that hard-coded dictionary,
Django never will support translations using the 'ti' language
code.

To avoid this problem, we will use the language code 'am' to
represent Tigrinya within the ChildCount+ Django application.

If you need the reports or dashboard to be translated into
Tigrinya, you must run the following command:

    sudo locale-gen am
    cd /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/django/conf/locale
    sudo cp -R en am
    cd - 

This creates stub Tigrinya translations for Django and enables
reports to be translated into Tigrinya.
